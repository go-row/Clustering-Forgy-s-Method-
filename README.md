# Clustering-Forgy-s-Method-

Your task is to write an algorithm to:

Generate a bi-variate data. Please create samples that occur in three clusters to begin with. You should have at least 5000 samples. Then using random initial seen points, perform clustering and check if across multiple runs - there is a significant change in the number of cluster members. For the deliverables: You should submit: A figure showing the original samples (in single color) but the different "Blobs" highlighting the intrinsic clustering should be evident. A second figure showing the sample samples in three different colors for the three clusters along with the cluster centroids also marked. Finally a line of text showing how many samples change places across different runs.
